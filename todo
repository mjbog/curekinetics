CureKinetics Class

    x Can instantiate curekinetics model
    x Define frequency factor A
    x Define activation energy E
    x Built in gas constant R
    x Define reaction order n and m

    Mechanism Function
    x Mechanism function computes correctly for nth order
    x f(0) = 1
    x f(1) = 0
    x f(0.5 | n = 2, m = 0) = 0.25
    x Mechanism function computes correctly for nth order
    x f(0) = 0
    x f(1) = 0
    x f(0.5 | n = 2, m = 1) = 0.125

    Rate Computation
    x Verify compute_arrhenius equation
